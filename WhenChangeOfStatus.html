	</div>
	<div class="Introduction">
		<p>  There are a set of conditions and requirements that the US government has set as mandatory for applying for a visa change of status. Amongst these 
			requirements, there are three basic conditions that are common to all possible requests. These conditions are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				You have to be in possesion of another nonimigrant visa.
			</li>
			<li>
				You have not commited any crime that would make you inelegible
			</li>
			<li>
				There is no other factor that requires you to leave USA prior to making a reentry based on a different classification.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Appart from these restrictions, there are several other status that are not allowed to change their condition.If you were admitted in any of the following nonimmigrant
		categories, you CANNOT change your nonimmigrant status and must depart the United States:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				C	(Alien in Transit)
			</li>
			<li>
				D	(Crewman)
			</li>
			<li>
				K-1 or K-2	(Fiancé(e) or Dependent ofFiancé(e))
			</li>
			<li>
				K-3 or K-4	(Certain Husbands and Wivesof U.S. Citizens and their Dependent Children)
			</li>
			<li>
				S	(Witness or Informant)
			</li>
			<li>
				TWOV 	(Transit without Visa)
			</li>
			<li>
				WT or WB	(Under the Visa Waiver Program, you would have been issued a green Form I-94W, Nonimmigrant Visa Waiver Arrival-Departure Record)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Finally, there is only one last restriction for those under an M1 visa. If you are currently in the country with this document, you must know
			that you are not allowed to obtain an F1 visa, but you may be eligible for an J1 student permit.</p>
